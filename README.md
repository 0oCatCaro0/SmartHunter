## Contributors

- Pull requests are welcome. Please submit to the dev branch.
- Make sure your PR has sufficient context/detail so I don't have to spend time guessing.
- Make sure your code is in line with the project conventions.
- Bug fixes: submit. If you're unsure, open an issue with your intent to fix so we can verify beforehand.
- New data: submit if you've found data in memory for supported features, e.g. new monsters, new status effects.
- New features: open an issue with your intent so we can scope it, because I'm unlikely to accept a random feature PR if it's a bit "out there".
